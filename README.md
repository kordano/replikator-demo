# Replikator Demo

A small counter demo for [replikator](https://github.com/kordano/replikator).

# Usage

Make sure you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager:

```
npm install
```

Start the dev server via:

```
npm start
```

You will see a test page with a counter that increases on button click. It will be replicated on our peer test-net.
